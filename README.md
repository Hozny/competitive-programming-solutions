A bunch of solutions to questions mainly from Mostafa Saad's [training sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839). 

Problems are organized according to the training sheet, (e.g, div2a may contain some b problems).
- note: a few questions are not accepted solutions.
