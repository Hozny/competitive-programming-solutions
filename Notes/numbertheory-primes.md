# Primes
## Quick Facts
2^31-1 and 2^61-1 are prime  
You can approximate number of primes up to $n$ with $\frac{n}{log(n)}$
>Wilson's Theorem: (p-1)! % p = p - 1 $\iff$ p is prime
- so (p-1)!+1 is divisible by p iff p is prime

>Godlbach's Conjecture: Any number $n$ can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers
